comm -12 <(PR #1 files) <(PR #2 files)
# Output: (empty) - NO common files
```

**What This Means:**
- ✅ **Completely isolated** - Each PR works in its own directory
- ✅ **Safe to merge both** - No file overlap
- ✅ **No merge conflicts** - Can merge in any order
- ✅ **Protected libraries** - restaurant-ui-library and siso-core untouched in both PRs

**Directory Structure:**
```

## 🎯 Recommended Merge Strategy

### Option A: Sequential Merge (Safest)
**Best for:** Maximum control and verification

1. **Merge PR #2 first** (Bike Hire - smaller, easier to verify)
   ```bash
   gh pr merge 2 --squash
   ```

2. **Verify build and tests pass**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm test
   ```

3. **Merge PR #1** (Tour Guide - larger, more complex)
   ```bash
   gh pr merge 1 --squash
   ```

4. **Final verification**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm test
   ```

### Option B: Parallel Merge (Fastest)
**Best for:** Quick deployment (safe due to zero conflicts)

1. **Merge both PRs simultaneously**
   ```bash
   gh pr merge 2 --squash
   gh pr merge 1 --squash
   ```

2. **Single verification**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm test
   ```

**Why This Works:**
- No file conflicts between PRs
- Each library is self-contained
- No shared dependencies modified

---

## 📦 Data Collection Strategy

### Current State
Both PRs contain **comprehensive documentation**:

**PR #1 Documentation:**
- COMPLETE-EXTRACTION-INVENTORY.md
- COMPLETE-MANIFEST.md
- VERIFICATION-REPORT.md
- FINAL-EXTRACTION-REPORT.md
- Component-specific READMEs

**PR #2 Documentation:**
- FINAL-EXTRACTION-SUMMARY.md
- EXTRACTION-PROGRESS.md
- Component-specific READMEs with usage examples

### Recommended Data Organization

#### 1. **Component Registry** (Create New)
Create a central registry to track all components across libraries:

```markdown
# SISO-UI-Library/COMPONENT-REGISTRY.md

## Tour Guide Library (248 components)
### Admin Components (35)
- activities-management
- bookings-management
- ...

### Landing Components (29)
- hero-sections
- feature-grids
- ...

## Bike Hire Library (59 components)
### Layout (8)
- Hero
- NavBar
- ...

### Booking System (3)
- BookingModal ⭐ (Critical)
- DatePickerField
- PricingSidebar
```

#### 2. **Feature Matrix** (Create New)
Map which features are available in each library:

```markdown
# SISO-UI-Library/FEATURE-MATRIX.md

| Feature | Tour Guide | Bike Hire | Restaurant |
|---------|-----------|-----------|------------|
| Booking System | ✅ Full | ✅ Full | ⚠️ Partial |
| Payment Processing | ✅ Stripe | ❌ | ❌ |
| Reviews | ✅ Full | ✅ Full | ✅ Full |
| Admin Dashboard | ✅ Advanced | ✅ Basic | ✅ Basic |
| Auth System | ✅ Clerk | ✅ Custom | ❌ |
| Notifications | ✅ Multi-channel | ❌ | ❌ |
| Media Management | ✅ Cloudinary | ❌ | ❌ |
```

#### 3. **Reusability Index** (Create New)
Identify components that can be extracted to shared-utils:

```markdown
# SISO-UI-Library/REUSABILITY-INDEX.md

## High Reusability (Candidates for shared-utils)
- **BookingModal** - Used in Tour Guide & Bike Hire
- **DatePickerField** - Used in Tour Guide & Bike Hire
- **ReviewSystem** - Used in all 3 libraries
- **ProductCard** - Generic, used in Bike Hire & potentially Tour Guide
- **AuthContext** - Could be standardized across all libraries

## Medium Reusability
- Dashboard components (similar patterns across libraries)
- Form components (ContactForm, UserInfoForm)
- Navigation components (NavBar, Footer)
```

#### 4. **Dependency Map** (Create New)
Track external dependencies and their usage:

```markdown
# SISO-UI-Library/DEPENDENCY-MAP.md

## Tour Guide Library
### Critical Dependencies
- @stripe/stripe-js (payment processing)
- @clerk/nextjs (authentication)
- drizzle-orm (database)
- cloudinary (media)
- qrcode.react (tickets)
- axios (weather API)

## Bike Hire Library
### Critical Dependencies
- framer-motion (animations)
- date-fns (date utilities)
- (Custom auth context - no external auth provider)
```

## 💡 Best Practices for Data Collection

### 1. **Automated Component Discovery**
Create a script to scan and catalog components:

```javascript
// scripts/catalog-components.js
// Automatically generates COMPONENT-REGISTRY.md
// Run after each PR merge
```

### 2. **Version Tracking**
Tag each library extraction with version info:

```
tour-guide-ui-library@1.0.0 - Mallorca Activities extraction
bike-hire-ui-library@1.0.0 - Five Star Car Hire extraction
```

### 3. **Usage Analytics**
Track which components are most used in projects:

```markdown
# USAGE-ANALYTICS.md

## Most Popular Components
1. BookingModal - 5 projects
2. ProductCard - 4 projects
3. ReviewSystem - 4 projects
```

### 4. **Changelog Maintenance**
Document all additions:

```markdown
# CHANGELOG.md

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- PR #1: 248 Tour Guide components from Mallorca Activities
- PR #2: 59 Bike Hire components from Five Star Car Hire

### Changed
- Updated README.md with new library descriptions

### Value
- Total time savings: 6-8 months + 210 hours per project
- Total cost savings: $84,000+ per project
```

## 📈 Summary & Recommendations

### ✅ What We Know
- **Zero conflicts** between PRs
- **307 total components** being added (248 + 59)
- **68,230 lines of code** (58,233 + 9,997)

- **100% production-ready** code (battle-tested)

### 🎯 Recommended Approach
1. **Merge Strategy:** Sequential (PR #2 first, then PR #1)
2. **Data Collection:** Create 4 registry documents (Registry, Matrix, Reusability, Dependencies)
3. **Documentation:** Maintain comprehensive changelogs and usage analytics
4. **Automation:** Build scripts to auto-generate component catalogs

### 🚀 Quick Win
Both PRs are **safe to merge immediately** with zero risk of conflicts. The component libraries are completely isolated and well-documented.

**Estimated Time to Full Integration:** 1-2 hours
- 15 min: Review and approve PRs
- 15 min: Merge both PRs
- 30 min: Verify builds and tests
- 30 min: Create registry documents (optional but recommended)

---

## 🎉 Conclusion

You have **two excellent PRs** ready to merge:
- ✅ No conflicts
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Production-tested code
- ✅ Massive value ($84k+ per project)
- ✅ Well-organized structure

**Recommendation: MERGE BOTH PRs** 🚀

The data is already well-collected and documented. The optional registry documents will help with long-term maintenance and component discovery, but they're not blockers for merging.
