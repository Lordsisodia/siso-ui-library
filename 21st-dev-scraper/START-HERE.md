# 🚀 21st.dev Scraper - START HERE!

## ✅ Everything is Ready to Go!

I've built you a **production-grade scraper** that will get all 1000 components safely over the next week!

---

## 🎯 **Quick Start - Get Top 50 NOW!**

### **Run These Commands**:

```bash
cd /Users/shaansisodia/DEV/PERSONAL/CLIENT-WORK/client-projects/Restraunt/SISO-UI-Library/21st-dev-scraper

# First time only: Install Playwright browsers (already done!)
# npx playwright install chromium

# Get top 50 components (15-20 mins)
npm run scrape:top50
```

**What Happens**:
- Opens 21st.dev in headless browser
- Finds all component URLs
- Downloads top 50 with 3-second delays
- Saves to `21st-dev-components/` folder
- Creates checkpoint for resume

---

## 📅 **Multi-Day Plan for All 1000**

### **This Week** (10-minute sessions each day):

**Today**:
```bash
npm run scrape:top50
```
→ **50 components**

**Tomorrow**:
```bash
npm run resume
```
→ **150 total**

**Day 3-7**: Keep running `npm run resume`
→ **500-700 total**

**Next Week**: Continue until 1000!

```

---

## 🎯 **Usage Commands**

### **Get Started (Top 50)**:
```bash
npm run scrape:top50
```

### **Continue (Resume)**:
```bash
npm run resume
```

### **Test First** (Recommended):
```bash
npm run test  # Only 5 components
```

### **Custom Batch**:
```bash
npm run scrape -- --limit=100 --batch=25
```

---

## 📊 **Expected Results**

### **Top 50** (Today):
- Time: 15-20 minutes
- Success: ~45 components
- Risk: Very low

### **By End of Week** (500 components):
- Total Time: ~3 hours (spread over 7 days)
- Success: ~450 components
- Risk: Low

### **Full 1000** (Next 2 Weeks):
- Total Time: ~5-6 hours (spread over 10-14 days)
- Success: ~850-900 components
- Risk: Medium (some might fail, that's OK!)

---

## 🚨 **Important Notes**

### **Rate Limiting Strategy**:
- **3 seconds** between each component (conservative)
- **50-100 per day** maximum (respectful)
- **Never run multiple sessions** at once

### **If Blocked**:
1. Wait 24 hours
2. Increase delay to 5 seconds
3. Resume with smaller batches (25 at a time)

### **Progress Tracking**:
Check your progress anytime:
```bash
cat scraper-checkpoint.json
```

---

## 🎯 **Comparison: CLI vs Scraper**

### **Their CLI**:
- ❌ Rate limited (5 free requests)
- ❌ No bulk download
- ❌ Would take 20+ hours manually
- ❌ Not feasible for 1000 components

### **Your Scraper**:
- ✅ No API rate limits
- ✅ Fully automated
- ✅ 5-6 hours total (spread over days)
- ✅ Resume capability
- ✅ Gets all 1000!

---

## 📖 **Next Steps**

### **TODAY**:
1. Test with 5 components:
   ```bash
   npm run test
   ```

2. If successful, run top 50:
   ```bash
   npm run scrape:top50
   ```

3. Review downloaded components in `21st-dev-components/`

### **THIS WEEK**:
4. Run `npm run resume` daily until you hit 500

### **NEXT WEEK**:
5. Continue to 1000 if you want more!

---

## 💡 **Pro Tips**

1. **Review quality as you go** - Stop when you have enough!
2. **Top 200 are probably the best** - Don't need all 1000
3. **Run during off-hours** (nights) - Less traffic
4. **Keep me posted** - I can adjust scraper if issues arise

---

## 🎊 **YOU'RE ALL SET!**

**Everything is configured and ready to go!**

**Run this to start**:
```bash
cd /Users/shaansisodia/DEV/PERSONAL/CLIENT-WORK/client-projects/Restraunt/SISO-UI-Library/21st-dev-scraper
npm run test  # Test with 5 first
npm run scrape:top50  # Then get top 50!
```

**Over next week**: Run `npm run resume` daily!

---

**Let's get those components!** 🚀🍽️
