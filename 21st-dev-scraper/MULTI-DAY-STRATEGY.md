## 🛡️ Safety Strategy

### **Per Session Limits**:

**Conservative** (Recommended):
- 50-100 components per day
- 3-second delays
- Very low risk

**Moderate**:
- 100-150 components per day
- 2-second delays
- Low risk

**Aggressive** (Not Recommended):
- 200+ components per day
- Risk of detection increases

### **If You Get Blocked**:

1. **Wait 24 hours**
2. **Increase delays**: Change `delayMs: 5000` in scraper.ts
3. **Reduce batch size**: Run 25 components at a time
4. **Resume**: Your progress is saved, just continue

---

## 📊 **Progress Tracking**

### **Check Progress Anytime**:

```bash
cat scraper-checkpoint.json
```

Shows:
```json
{
  "totalFound": 1000,
  "downloaded": 250,
  "failed": 5,
  "lastRunDate": "2025-10-20",
  "nextStartIndex": 255
}
```

### **View Downloaded Components**:

```bash
ls -R 21st-dev-components/by-author/
```

### **Count Downloaded**:

```bash
find 21st-dev-components -name "*.tsx" | wc -l
```

---

## 🎯 **Recommended Schedule**

### **Fast Track** (10 days, ~3 hours total):
- 100 components per day
- 30 mins per session
- Total: 1000 in 10 days

### **Slow & Steady** (20 days, ~3 hours total):
- 50 components per day
- 15 mins per session
- Total: 1000 in 20 days

### **Balanced** (7 days, ~3 hours total):
- 150 components per day
- 45 mins per session
- Total: 1000 in 7 days

**My Recommendation**: Balanced approach (7 days)

---

## 🚨 **When to Stop Early**

### **You Probably Don't Need All 1000!**

**Consider stopping after**:
- **200 components**: You'll have all the best ones
- **500 components**: Comprehensive collection
- **When you find what you need**: Quality over quantity!

**Reality Check**:
- Top 200 = 90% of the good stuff
- Many components are duplicates/variations
- Focus on what your restaurant app needs

---

## 💡 **Smart Filtering Strategy**

### **While Scraping, Focus On**:

**For Restaurant App Priority**:
1. **Animations** - Hero sections, transitions
2. **Forms** - Booking, contact
3. **Navigation** - Menus, headers
4. **Cards** - Menu items, testimonials
5. **Modals** - Booking dialogs

**Skip**:
- Admin-heavy components (unless you need admin panel)
- Enterprise dashboards
- Blockchain/crypto components
- Social media integrations (unless needed)

---

## 📋 **Daily Checklist**

### **Each Day When You Run**:

1. **Run scraper**:
   ```bash
   npm run resume
   ```

2. **Check progress**:
   ```bash
   cat scraper-checkpoint.json
   ```

3. **Review new components** (optional):
   ```bash
   ls 21st-dev-components/by-author/
   ```

4. **Check for errors**:
   - Look at failed count
   - Review error messages
   - Decide if worth retrying

5. **Stop or Continue**:
   - Stop if you have enough
   - Continue if want more
   - Take breaks (be nice to their servers!)

---

## 🎯 **Success Metrics**

### **By End of Week 1**:
- ✅ 500+ components
- ✅ All major categories covered
- ✅ Best components secured
- ✅ Enough for any restaurant app

### **By End of Week 2** (If Continuing):
- ✅ 1000 components
- ✅ Complete collection
- ✅ Every category covered
- ✅ More than you'll ever need!

---

## 🔥 **Pro Tips**

1. **Run during off-hours** (nights/weekends)
   - Less traffic to their site
   - Lower detection risk

2. **Review as you go**
   - Check quality every 100 components
   - Stop if quality drops

3. **Bookmark favorites**
   - Note the best components
   - Create your own "top 10" list

4. **Share progress**
   - Keep me posted on issues
   - I can adjust scraper if needed

---

## 📞 **If Issues Arise**

### **Scraper Fails**:
- Check `scraper-checkpoint.json` for last successful
- Run with `--limit=5` to test
- Increase delays if needed

### **Getting Blocked**:
- Wait 24 hours
- Resume with higher delays
- Reduce batch size

### **Need Help**:
- Check error logs in checkpoint file
- DM me the error
- We'll adjust strategy
