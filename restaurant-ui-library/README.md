# Restaurant UI Component Library

A curated collection of reusable UI components for restaurant applications.

## 📁 Structure

```
restaurant-ui-library/
├── components/          # Component folders (one per UI element)
├── assets/             # Original component images
├── metadata/           # Component metadata and specifications
├── docs/               # Process guides, prompts, and reference material
└── catalog.json        # AI-readable component catalog
```

## 📚 Documentation

Supporting guides and reference material live in `docs/`:
- `docs/guides/` – onboarding workflows, import playbooks, and setup checklists
- `docs/reference/` – category mappings, component index, and structure notes
- `docs/prompts/` – reusable system prompts and copy-paste templates

## 🎯 Purpose

This library provides:
- **Reusable Components**: Pre-designed UI elements ready for implementation
- **AI Analysis**: Structured data for automated component evaluation
- **Design Consistency**: Standardized patterns across restaurant applications
- **Quick Prototyping**: Rapid assembly of restaurant interfaces

## 📊 Component Catalog

Each component includes:
- **Visual Reference**: Original design image
- **Metadata**: Component type, category, complexity
- **Usage Context**: Where and how to use the component
- **Technical Specs**: Implementation notes and requirements
- **AI Analysis**: Automated quality scores and recommendations

## 🤖 AI Analysis

This library is optimized for AI analysis with:
- Structured JSON catalog for programmatic access
- Consistent naming conventions
- Semantic categorization
- Quality metrics and scoring
- Recommendation engine data

## 🚀 Usage

Browse the `components/` directory to explore available UI elements. Each component folder contains:
- Original design image
- Component metadata (JSON)
- Implementation notes
- Usage examples

## 📝 Adding Components

1. Add image to `assets/`
2. Create component folder in `components/`
3. Generate metadata
4. Update `catalog.json`
5. Commit and push to GitHub
