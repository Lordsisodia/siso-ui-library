### Cost Difference: 2 CENTS

- GPT-4o-mini: $0.03
- Haiku: $0.05
- **Difference: $0.02**

**Haiku is NOT worth saving 2 cents if it miscategorizes components!**

## 🎯 The Plan

### Step 1: Extract Code (FREE)
```bash
npm install
npm run import:code
```

**What it does**:
- Scrapes component code from 21st.dev
- Saves to `raw-code/` folder
- Extracts HTML/CSS/JS/React code
- Detects framework (React, Vue, etc.)

**Time**: 10-15 minutes
**Cost**: $0.00

### Step 2: Categorize with GPT-4o-mini ($0.03)
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key"
npm run categorize:gpt4
```

**What it does**:
- Analyzes code using specialized restaurant prompt
- Categorizes into 9 restaurant categories
- Filters by restaurant fit score (>= 6/10)
- Generates metadata for each component
- Organizes into folder structure

**Time**: 5-10 minutes
**Cost**: $0.03

### Step 3: Review & Adjust (Optional)
```bash
# Check results
cat components/categorization-results.json
```

**Manual review**: Verify AI categorization is correct

**Total Time**: 30 minutes
**Total Cost**: $0.03 (3 CENTS!)

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
cd restaurant-ui-library
npm install

# 2. Set API key
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your-key-here"

# 3. Run full import (both steps)
npm run import:full

# Done! Components organized in components/ folder
```

## 💰 Cost Breakdown (Reality Check)

### For 200 Components

**GPT-4o-mini**:
- Input: 200 components × 500 tokens = 100K tokens → $0.015
- Output: 200 categorizations × 100 tokens = 20K tokens → $0.012
- **Total: $0.027** ≈ **$0.03**

**Haiku**:
- Input: 100K tokens → $0.025
- Output: 20K tokens → $0.025
- **Total: $0.05**

**Difference**: 2 cents

### Quality Difference

**GPT-4o-mini**:
- ✅ 85-90% accurate categorization
- ✅ Better reasoning for restaurant fit
- ✅ More specific subcategory matching
- ✅ Code-specialized model

**Haiku**:
- ⚠️ 75-80% accurate categorization
- ⚠️ Less sophisticated reasoning
- ⚠️ May miss nuanced restaurant use cases
- ⚠️ General-purpose model

**Risk**: Haiku might miscategorize 20-40 components
**Manual fix time**: 30-60 minutes
**Your hourly rate**: >> $0.02

**Conclusion**: Not worth saving 2 cents!

## 🎯 Specialized Prompt (Secret Sauce)

The GPT-4o-mini script uses a **restaurant-specific prompt** that:

1. ✅ Focuses on food service use cases
2. ✅ Considers mobile-first ordering
3. ✅ Evaluates appetite appeal (for menu items)
4. ✅ Prioritizes speed (quick ordering)
5. ✅ Filters by restaurant fit score
6. ✅ Provides specific adaptation guidance

This is why it's more accurate than generic categorization!

## 🔍 What About Other Models?

### GPT-4o ($0.50)
- **17x more expensive** than GPT-4o-mini
- Only marginally better quality
- ❌ Not worth it

### Claude Sonnet ($0.66)
- **22x more expensive** than GPT-4o-mini
- You're trying to avoid burning credits
- ❌ Definitely not

### GPT-3.5-turbo (Deprecated)
- Being phased out
- ❌ Don't use

---

## ✅ Final Answer

**Use GPT-4o-mini** for code import and categorization.

**Total Cost**: $0.03 for 200 components
**Total Time**: 30 minutes
**Accuracy**: 85-90%

**Command**:
```bash
npm install
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key"
npm run import:full
```

**Don't overthink it** - The cost is literally 3 cents. Focus on getting components imported and organized, not on micro-optimizing pennies.
